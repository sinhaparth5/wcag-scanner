## Coding Standards
### TypeScript Style Guide
We follow the [Airbnb TypeScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with some modifications defined in our `eslintrc.config.js` file.

Key points:
 - Use 2 spaces for indentation
 - Use single quotes for strings
 - Use camelCase for variables and functions
 - Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
 - Add proper JSDoc comments for all public APIs
 - Maximum line length is 100 characters

### Testing

 - All new features should have accompanying tests
 - Aim for high test coverage
 - Both unit and integration tests are appreciated

### Documentation

 - Document all public APIs using JSDoc comments
 - Update README.md if necessary
 - Update any relevant documentation in /docs folder
 - Document complex algorithms and workflows

### Accessibility Standards
As this is an accessibility tool, we hold ourselves to high standards:

1. All new UI components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards at minimum
2. Follow semantic HTML practices
3. Test with screen readers when applicable
4. Ensure keyboard navigability

### Git Commit Messages

 - Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
 - Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
 - Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
 - Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
